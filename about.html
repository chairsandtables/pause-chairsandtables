<i>The best way to get a chair at the table is to build one yourself.</i>
</p>

<p>Asad Chishti and Jonathon Reed are explorers.</p>

<p>Born in the Fall, a few years and several thousand kilometers apart, following their twin sisters, they ended up at the same university; Asad is passionate about potlucks, maps, and naps, and Jonathon about breaking down gender norms, ukuleles, and education. Between the two of them they've worked on projects with/for the Occupy Movement, Idle No More, Humans of Kingston, Vanhawks, TEDxQueensU, Awesome Kingston, Queen's Journal, CFRC, Jack.org, Ontario Youth Parliament, Adjacent Possibilities, MaRSDD, and more.</p>

<p>Chairs and Tables (CHAT) is a project we plan to work on till ~2024. Our North Star project is a multilayered-onion-like-map for Canada's 150th which will have layers driven by archives, data, audio, video, images, and more. Some of our projects are <a href="http://explore.chairsandtables.org">Explore</a> (a time capsule), <a href="http://fyl.chairsandtables.org">Finding Yourself Lost</a> (a podcast), <a href="http://tilde-university.github.io">TU</a> (a university), and we've got a grand total of 16 active projects which are slowly being sculpted. They range from <a href="/cambodia">tiny</a> to large*. We're fun to work with and have lots of feathers and caps, so get in touch.

*For example, we pick an annual theme (Happiness, Home) to research for four seasons and write a report on. The current annual theme is <strong>Health</strong> and we're looking for at least 131 guests to our digital-publishing-potluck.
