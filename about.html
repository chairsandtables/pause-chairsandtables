<p>The best way to get a chair at the table is to build one yourself.

<p>Asad Chishti and Jonathon Reed are storytellers and explorers who met while studying in the city of Kingston. 

<p>Born in October, a few years and several thousand kilometers apart, following their twin sisters. Asad is passionate about designing for harmless living and Jonathon about breaking down gender norms. Between the two of them they've worked on projects like the Occupy Movement, Idle No More, Humans of Kingston, Vanhawks, TEDxQueensU, Awesome Kingston, Queen's Journal, The Jack Project, Ontario Youth Parliament, and MaRSDD. 

<p>For the past two years, Jonathon's been writing down the highlight of each day and Asad's been taking a photo-a-day.

<p>Aside from our ongoing projects (<a href="">the podcast</a> and the time capsule) we're dedicating most of our efforts to preparing a cartographical-time-traveling-storytelling-museum-wonderland for Canada's 150th birthday in 2017.
