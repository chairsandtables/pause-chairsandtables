<div class="annualtheme">
	<h1>Health</h1>
	<p>A <a href="http://chairsandtables.org">Chairs and Tables</a> Theme (along with <a href="/happiness">Happiness</a> and <a href="/home">Home</a>)</p>
</div>

	<ul>

	</ul>

	<p>Every year Chairs and Tables picks a theme to research for at least four seasons. We then start writing a report on it. They take a while to get finished but ... we're working on 'em. It was a coincidence that all of our themes so far have begun with an 'h'. <a href="/happiness">Happiness</a>, <a href="/home">Home</a> and now Health.</p>

	<p>For 2015 the theme is 'Health' and instead of biking across a country or individually meeting people at their homes, we've asked people to respond to the prompt:

	<br/><blockquote>what good health means to you and how you maintain/strive-towards it.</blockquote>

	</p>

	<p>The editorial team consists of Asad Chishti, Caroline Crocker, and Andrew Pitkin. With support from Jonathon Reed and a collaboration with Lorenzo Colocado whose project Rise over Run, in part, inspired this.</p> 

	<p>If you'd be interested in submitting something or reaching out, <a href="mailto:ac[at]chairsandtables[dot]org">send Asad an email</a>.</p>
