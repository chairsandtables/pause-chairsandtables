<font face="monospace"><h1>Lost</h1>

<p>Part of the process of looking, for me, has been the discovery that life is a process of creating who you want to be rather than finding. But I do believe that we can find parts of ourselves in other people, places, or (sometimes) objects.

<p>Time goes by so fast, so don't wish your days away. It is hard at times. It is okay to feel lost and overwhelmed and uncertain and confused. Maybe you won’t feel that way - I just wish, looking back, someone had told me this.

<p>There are thousands of paths. So you must ask yourself: ‘Does this path have a heart?’ <br/>If it does, the path is good. If it doesn't, it is of no use.

<p>Always remember that it doesn't matter if you take a small step or a big step as long as it is a step forward. <br/>(But sometimes it is okay to stand still.)

<p>Choose your words wisely, think before you speak, and speak words that build and do not destroy. <br/>Think of the places you call home and remember that you’re welcome home anytime.

<p>Life is not easy, there are lots of ups and downs. Try to work hard, do your best, be patient with yourself when you fail because it gives you time to sort out where your problem was and try to correct it. Always remember those who’ve worked hard to get you where you are. It is good to look upward because it motivates you to work harder but look downward too so that you appreciate your position. Be happy with what you have because many people can’t imagine or dream of all that you do have.

<p>Read voraciously. Surround yourself with excellent company.

<p>Don’t be afraid to be wrong. But more importantly, don’t be afraid to call people out on what they’re doing, whether it’s good or bad. We tend to fail at living in the moment, at realizing what we are actually doing and how we impact others. The best thing you can do for yourself and others is to observe, analyze, and articulate your thoughts. Those who are bothered will learn and those who will appreciate it will be refreshed. Be restless just never let yourself forget what really makes you tick.

<p>What do you want more than anything else in the world?* 
<br/>What do you love?


<p>*What you want isn't always what you need.

<p>Love,
