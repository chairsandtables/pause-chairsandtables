	<h1>The Intro</h1>
	<p>For six months in 2017, we are bicycling this distance across Canada; from the Avalon Peninsula on the Atlantic Ocean, to the Mackenzie Delta near the Arctic, to Vancouver Island in the Pacific. As we cross the country, we will develop an image of Canada as it is today — a snapshot of the present that provides context from the past in order to create a vision for the future. This image will take the form of research and documentation based on different layers of Canada’s story. Colonization. Food security. Water systems. Democracy. And so on.</p>
	<p>For an image to tell a story, it needs a focal point. Therefore, we will be striving to find the individuals and stories that shape and hold Canada’s local histories. We believe that a vital part of Canada lives in the enduring wayside; the townships, reserves, routes and ecosystems that act as repositories of memory and trauma — those that are often spoken for but rarely listened to. Our research method is to connect with groups that are already doing this kind of work who will let us into their communities and enable us to follow leads. Our goal is to highlight the spaces in between the lines of the carefully crafted narrative of what makes this country true and strong and free by documenting the quieter parts of Canada’s story.</p>
	<p>A story, however, is only as good as the way it is told. So we will be pouring our efforts into an online hand-crafted map that will grow wider and deeper as we move across the country. This map will be the structure onto which we build the research layers. Using our bicycle wheels, camera lenses and audio recorders, we will interweave politics, histories, marginalized communities, ecological systems and individual stories in our exploration of what Canada is, has been, and may grow up to be. Through it all will be an evocative, personal journey that balances investigation and reflection amongst the diverse communities and wild spaces of the Canadian landscape.</p>
	<p>We hope that our ability to document and develop these layers of Canada’s national identity will inspire and challenge our fellow citizens to think critically about their contribution to what we collectively become in the next fifty years.</p>
